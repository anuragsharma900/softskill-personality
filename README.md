Personality plays a key role in predicting many factors of an individual such as mental and physical health, career fit, and well-being.
Hence, getting a deep insight into a person’s soft-skills is of key importance.

Theory of psychological types described by C. G. Jung was transformed into 16 indicators by Isabel Briggs Myers, and her mother, Katharine Briggs.


The Myers Briggs Type Indicator (or MBTI for short) is a personality type system that divides everyone into 16 distinct personality types across 4 axes:
Introversion (I) – Extroversion (E)
Intuition (N) – Sensing (S)  
Thinking (T) – Feeling (F
Judging (J) – Perceiving (P)

The dataset from Personality Cafe online  is composed of 8675 unique users each with their 4 letter MBTI code along with 50 post utterances. The distribution of the data by type is displayed on the right. 
	
“(MBTI) Myers-Briggs Personality Type Dataset”,  contains 
	•	Type (This person 4 letter MBTI code/Type)
	•	A section of each of the last 50 things they have posted (Each entry separated by “|||” (3 pipe characters))

The ‘Personality Test Model’ based on MBTI assessment from social media comment data would predict the relevance of the famous MBTI system. The purpose is to see if any patterns can be detected in specific types and their style of writing, which overall explores the validity of the test in analyzing, predicting, or categorizing behavior and later testing the models to predict the personality by feeding a few of the writings.
